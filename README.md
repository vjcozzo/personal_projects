# Personal Projects
A space for some of my favorite programs I've developed/implemented.

Often these have been inspired by courses I've taken, or by online tutorials.

# Current projects
## Sorting algorithms, Implemented in C (Inspired by Algorithms Class CMSC351)
*   Mergesort
*   Heapsort
*   Quicksort
## Other programs
*   Heap's algorithm, to generate a Hamiltonian Path through the permutations of n integers
*   Selection (finds the kth minimum element in an arbitrary list of integers) -- C implementation, inspired by Algorithms class
*   Time display -- displays the current unix epoch time
*   Networking in C -- going throug a tutorial by Mr. Brain Hall

# Future projects
Other projects are in development, such as:
*   Euclidean Algorithm, programmed in Assembly (NASM)
*   Program to solve modular equations, using Chinese Remainder Theorem

# Any ideas / plans for a project ?
If you want to start a project, email me at vcozzo@umd.edu.
