# Personal Projects
A space for some of my favorite programs I've developed.

Often these have been inspired by courses I've taken, or by online tutorials.

*   Mergesort -- C implementation
*   Quicksort -- C implementation, with executable and compiled assembly
*   Time display -- displays the current unix epoch time

Other projects are in progress.
